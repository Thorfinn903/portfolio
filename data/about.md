I am a Python-focused backend developer and ERPNext specialist with hands-on experience in building, customizing, and supporting business-critical systems.

I have worked extensively with ERPNext and the Frappe Framework, where I configured workflows, permissions, reports, and resolved real production issues for live clients. My work focuses on simplifying complex business processes and automating manual workflows.

I am particularly interested in building backend-heavy B2B solutions, especially for traditional industries like textiles, where performance, reliability, and usability for non-technical users matter the most.

Currently, I am strengthening my backend architecture skills, working with FastAPI and modern frontend tools, and learning how AI systems can be integrated into real products.
